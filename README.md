Hello! I made a Quote Generaotr using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every time you visit the site, it will display a quote and author from an api (credits to "lukePeavy"). 
I added a button that will generate new quote when it is clicked on. The other button allows you to share this quote on the Twitter/X. Enjoy!!
